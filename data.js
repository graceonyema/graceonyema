      comment: `I began my publishing journey on Amazon and after publishing the first eBook, I didn’t go further than that. My major challenge was getting the exact dimension and formatting requirements correctly. After several failed attempts to get it right, I reached out to Grace for her expert opinion. Grace Onyema didn’t only give me an expert opinion, she published the books, set up my Amazon & payment accounts accurately, and even monitored the progress and many more.
      I thought I had seen the end when she appeared again and further rendered her assistance to ensure my books hit the bestselling spots on Amazon, and even assisted with the process of getting my books printed and shipped to Nigeria.
      I must commend her speed, accuracy, patience in answering all my many questions, care, and great concern. At some point, I wondered if Grace Onyema was a staff of Amazon. She is more than an expert, thank you Grace Onyema. I recommend her Amazon publishing services, as she makes the process of Amazon publishing very easy and stress-free.
